# BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE DEVICE
This was a really cool and tasking school project I worked on with a couple of friends, developing a digitized means of registering for courses and taking class attendance for students and teachers.

The project used an LCD touchscreen, a Fingerprint scanner, an external memory card and two Atmel Atmega328 microcontrollers.\
We had to use two microcontrollers because of pin count and access to specific I/O buses.
