# AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PROJECT USING THE INVENT ONE(R)
Jun 2018 â€“ Jul 2018

This was a really cool project I developed and got to demo at a National Technology Conference.

Theproject was built to demonstrate the robustness of the **Invent-One** dev board (built on ESP-12 core).

The vehicle used ultrasonic range finders to determine distances from obstacles while in motion. Using motors to orient its sensor, the vehicle could autonomously determine the direction to turn and even perform a complete 360 degree turn, to avoid hitting any obstacles.\
Strapped with 4 lithium-ion polymer batteries, the vehicle could drive around autonomously for about 45mins to an hour before needing a recharge (the batteries weren't that great :no_mouth: ).


To build this project, you would need the following components:
1. Invent One Prototyping Board
2. HCSR04 Ultrasonic Range Finder
3. Servo Motor
4. L298N DC Motor Driver
5. Rover chasis and 4 DC motors

Assembly instructions can be readily found online or by reading the assembly manual.
